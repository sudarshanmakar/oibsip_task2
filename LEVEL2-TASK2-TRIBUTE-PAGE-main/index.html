          <h2>Prime Minister of the Republic of India</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Jawaharlal Nehru</b> 14 November 1889 – 27 May 1964) was an
            Indian politician, anti-colonial nationalist, politician, diplomat,
            journalist[2] and author who was a central figure in India during
            the middle of the 20th century. A secular humanist and social
            democrat,[3] Nehru was a principal leader of the Indian nationalist
            movement in the 1930s and 1940s. Upon India's independence in 1947,
            he served as the country's prime minister for 17 years. Nehru
            promoted parliamentary democracy, secularism, pacifism and science
            and technology during the 1950s, powerfully influencing India's arc
            as a modern nation. In international affairs, he steered India clear
            of the two blocs of the Cold War. <br />
            <br />
            A well-regarded author, his books written in prison, such as Letters
            from a Father to His Daughter (1929), An Autobiography (1936) and
            The Discovery of India (1946), have been read around the world. The
            son of Motilal Nehru, a prominent lawyer and Indian nationalist,
            Jawaharlal Nehru was educated in England—at Harrow School and
            Trinity College, Cambridge, and trained in the law at the Inner
            Temple. He became a barrister, returned to India, enrolled at the
            Allahabad High Court and gradually began to take an interest in
            national politics, which eventually became a full-time occupation.
            He joined the Indian National Congress, rose to become the leader of
            a progressive faction during the 1920s, and eventually of the
            Congress, receiving the support of Mahatma Gandhi who was to
            designate Nehru as his political heir. As Congress president in
            1929, Nehru called for complete independence from the British Raj.
            Nehru and the Congress dominated Indian politics during the 1930s.
            Nehru promoted the idea of the secular nation-state in the 1937
            Indian provincial elections, allowing the Congress to sweep the
            elections, and to form governments in several provinces.<br />
            <br />
            In September 1939, the Congress ministries resigned to protest
            Viceroy Lord Linlithgow's decision to join the war without
            consulting them. After the All India Congress Committee's Quit India
            Resolution of 8 August 1942, senior Congress leaders were imprisoned
            and for a time the organization was crushed. Nehru, who had
            reluctantly heeded Gandhi's call for immediate independence, and had
            desired instead to support the Allied war effort during World War
            II, came out of a lengthy prison term to a much altered political
            landscape. The Muslim League, under Muhammad Ali Jinnah, had come to
            dominate Muslim politics in the interim. In the 1946 provincial
            elections, Congress won the elections but the League won all the
            seats reserved for Muslims, which the British interpreted to be a
            clear mandate for Pakistan in some form. Nehru became the interim
            prime minister of India in September 1946, with the League joining
            his government with some hesitancy in October 1946.

              In 1955, Nehru was awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest
              civilian honour. President Rajendra Prasad awarded him the honour
              without taking advice from the Prime Minister as would be the
              normal constitutional procedure as Nehru himself was Prime
              Minister then.
